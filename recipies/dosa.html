        <li>Place your tawa on stove and let it heat for a few minutes, apply some oil over the tawa</li>
        <li>Once the tawa is heated, take the batter in a spatula and pour it on the tawa and start making concentric circles in-order to spread the dosa evenly</li>

        <li>Take off the lid, and flip the dosa with a flat stick, the dosa should appear golden brown (in case the dosa is dark brown/ black it got roasted too much, reduce the amount of time you let the batter roast next time)</li>
